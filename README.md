### Blackjack 

## My process
I decided to build a game with javascript, since it is more efficient with numbers and I want to challenge myself with javascript.

## Built with
HTML5
CSS3
JavaScript

## Development
The cards don't have spades, diamonds or hearts. It is only numbers with add/subtract and equal. This game automatically counts for you like calculator.
