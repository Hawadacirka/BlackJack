### Blackjack 

## Process
I decided to build a game with javascript, since it is more efficient with numbers and I want to challenge myself with javascript.

## Built with
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

## Development
The cards don't feature spades, diamonds, or hearts. They only display numbers along with addition, subtraction, and equal signs.
